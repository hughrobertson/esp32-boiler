Create a repository for that directory...

  git init

A directory named .git is added to the MotorThing directory.  That directory is the Git repository.


Add all the working files to the index (note the dot at the end).

  git add .

The index can be checked with the status command...

  git status



When changes should be "saved" (commit in Git nomenclature) simply...

  git commit


enter commit comment


Or, the comment can be included in the command...

  git commit -m "Initial commit."



or

 git commit -a -m "Start adding serial debugging."

git diff

end
 git commit -a -m "Bad news.  Dead end.  And a terrible mess."

git revert HEAD --no-edit
